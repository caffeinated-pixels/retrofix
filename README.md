# Retrofix - a Netflix clone

Inspired by Karl Hadwen's "Netflix in React JS" course on Scrimba, I'm building my own Netflix clone from scratch.

It's still a work in progress, but I'm happy with how it's progressing and confident that it will show that I'm a capable React developer. I'm also having fun customizing it and curating my own pretend streaming content üòÅ

There is now a [live version up](https://retrofix.netlify.app/) on Netlify.

Technologies used:

- React
- React Router (React Library)
- Styled-Components (React library)
- Fuse.js (JS library for fuzzy searching)
- Firebase authentication
