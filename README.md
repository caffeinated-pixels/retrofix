# Retrofix - a Netflix clone

Inspired by Karl Hadwen's "Netflix in React JS" course on Scrimba, I'm building my own Netflix clone from scratch.

It's still very much a work in progress, but I'm happy with how it's progressing and confident that it will show that I'm a capable React developer. I'm also having fun customizing it and curating my own content üòÅ

I'm hoping to have a live version up soon.

Technologies used:

- React
- React Router (React Library)
- Styled-Components (React library)
- Firebase authentication
